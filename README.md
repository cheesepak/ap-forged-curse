# Forged Curse (working title)

A lone dwarf follows a peculiar white cricket through dark tunnels and stumbles upon the entrance to a long forgotten, ancient forge. Once sealed away by unknown magic, the outer barrier is weak enough to enter and explore. Fight strange creatures and discover the mystery of the Forged Curse in this Rogue-clone made in Pico-8 with [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg/) implementation.
